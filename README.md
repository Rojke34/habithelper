# habithelper

it was a trainer time to involve into SwiftUI world, my first time use it, I really like it.

Why I developed it? to help myself with my activivtes such as Read a book, play the Kalimba, go for a walk even drink water or buy Bitcoin 

I used te Apple developer tutorial to achived this. I learned a lot from that.
